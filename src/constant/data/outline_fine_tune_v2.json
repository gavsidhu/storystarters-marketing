    "prompt": "After the sinking of a cargo ship, a solitary lifeboat remains bobbing on the wild blue Pacific. The only survivors from the wreck are a sixteen-year-old boy named Pi, a hyena, a wounded zebra, an orangutan—and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger.\n\nSoon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi Patel, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with the tiger, Richard Parker, for 227 days while lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them \"the truth.\" After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional—but is it more true?\n~~~",
    "completion": " \nAct I\n\nPi's childhood and youth. His family owns and runs a zoo in their hometown in India, and his father is emphatic about being aware of the wildness and true nature of animals.\n\nEarly in Pi’s life, his father realizes that his son’s naiveté about the tiger in their care may put Pi in danger. To illustrate how true and real the threat is, he forces the children to watch the tiger kill and eat a goat.\n\nPi goes through a significant religious awakening in his formative years, eventually subscribing to a variety of religions: Hinduism, Catholicism, and finally Islam.\n\nWhen Pi is a teenager, his family decides to sell the animals and immigrate to Canada on a cargo ship named Tsimtsum. A terrible storm occurs during the voyage, and when Pi, excited to see the storm, goes onto the ship’s deck, he is tossed overboard and into a lifeboat by the crew.\n\nAct II\n\nThe next morning, Pi finds himself in the company of a badly injured zebra, a vicious hyena, and a matronly orangutan named Orange Juice. Hiding out of sight, beneath the canvas of the lifeboat, is the tiger Richard Parker.\n\nThe hyena wounds and eats the zebra, then goes after Orange Juice. The orangutan puts up a good fight, but the hyena ultimately kills her. Richard Parker finally makes himself known by killing and eating the hyena. Now only Pi and Richard Parker survive on the lifeboat.\n\nPi realizes he must survive the elements while adrift in the lifeboat—and that Richard Parker will almost certainly eat him. He quickly sees that thirst will kill him sooner than hunger or the tiger, so he sets about finding a way to get water. He discovers provisions stored in the lifeboat, including biscuits, water, water purifiers, a whistle, and a handbook for surviving at sea.\n\nWith the tools of survival in hand, Pi builds a second watercraft—a raft made of oars and lifejackets—and attaches it to the boat. With this second watercraft, he can remain out of both the shark-infested waters and Richard Parker’s immediate reach. He considers a variety of survival options and concludes that he must tame the tiger. Although he is unable to fully train and domesticate Richard Parker, by blowing a whistle and rocking the lifeboat enough to make the tiger seasick, Pi is able to subdue him and secure his own territory on the lifeboat.\n\nPi goes temporarily blind and loses his mind. He begins having a conversation with Richard Parker in which they mutually fantasize about the kinds of foods they would like to eat. Pi fixates on vegetarian delicacies, and Richard Parker continues to revise the recipes with meat as the main ingredient. At first Pi is morally outraged at the idea of eating meat, but then he realizes that it is Richard Parker’s preference.\n\nDuring this fantastical exchange, another castaway in a lifeboat appears, also blind and also very hungry. Pi allows the man, who speaks with a French accent, on the lifeboat, believing him to be a true companion. The man attacks Pi, saying that he intends to eat him; Richard Parker attacks and consumes the man.\n\nAct III\n\nRichard Parker and Pi eventually find an island, which is made entirely of trees, roots, leaves, fresh water, and plants. However, Pi makes a horrible discovery that causes them to leave the island: Believing he has found a fruit-bearing tree, Pi peels back the layers of a piece of fruit to find that it contains a human tooth. The island is a carnivorous being, consuming everything that lives on it. Pi and Richard Parker return to the lifeboat and the ocean.\n\nAn undetermined amount of time passes, and Pi and Richard Parker arrive in Mexico. Richard Parker runs into the wild and is never seen again. Pi is brought into custody, given food, and questioned for some time by two officials from the Maritime Department in the Japanese Ministry of Transport.\n\nThe officials’ transcript of the conversation reveals that they do not believe Pi’s story in its entirety, and they tell him so. Initially Pi sticks to his story, but then he offers them another, somewhat similar story in which he shares the lifeboat with a crew member of the sunken ship, his own mother, and a foul-tempered French cook who eventually kills both Pi’s mother and the crewman. Pi tells of how he then stabbed the French cook in the throat and watched him die. This second account seems to satisfy the skepticism of the questioners, but they admit to Pi that his account of surviving with the tiger aboard the lifeboat is a better story.\n==="

Ford Prefect, Arthur's friend, arrives and convinces him to leave and get a drink. Ford is secretly from a small planet near Betelgeuse and works as a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a galactic repository of knowledge.\n\nFord has discovered that a Vogon Constructor fleet is heading toward Earth to destroy it to make way for a galactic bypass. The fleet arrives and its leader, Prostetnic Jeltz, announces that Earth has been scheduled for demolition. Earth is destroyed and Ford and Arthur manage to hitch a ride on Jeltz's starship. Arthur learns about Ford's true origins, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the usefulness of towels.\n\nAct II\n\nFord and Arthur are thrown out of an airlock but are, against the odds, picked up by a starship called the Heart of Gold. The Heart of Gold is equipped with a depressed robot named Marvin and controlled by a cheerful computer named Eddie. The starship's drive creates a wake of improbability when it is activated, and for this reason, the Heart of Gold picked up Ford and Arthur on its own.\n\nThe two-headed, three-armed, impetuous Zaphod Beeblebrox became Galactic President to steal the Heart of Gold and its unique Infinite Improbability Drive, a propulsion system that allows the starship to travel through all points in the galaxy in less than a second. Zaphod is accompanied by Trillian, a young woman from Earth whom Arthur once tried to pick up at a party.\n\nThe Infinite Improbability Drive brings the crew to Magrathea, a planet that had once designed custom planets for the galaxy's wealthiest inhabitants. The Heart of Gold begins to descend to the planet's surface, which triggers the planetary defense system, launching two nuclear missiles at the Heart of Gold. Despite taking evasive action, the starship cannot outrun the missiles. At the last second, Arthur turns on the Infinite Improbability Drive in the hope of avoiding certain death, and the missiles turn into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale.\n\nAct III\n\nThe Heart of Gold lands on Magrathea, where Zaphod discovers an entrance into Magrathea's interior. Leaving Arthur and Marvin to stand guard, Zaphod, Trillian, and Ford search the tunnels, where Zaphod explains that he discovered that he tampered with his own memories to prevent himself from realizing why he wanted to find Magrathea. A door suddenly slams down, trapping the group. The tunnel fills with gas, and Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian pass out.\n\nWhile standing guard, Arthur encounters Slartibartfast, a Magrathean. The two travel in an aircar to Slartibartfast's office, where he reveals that Earth was an organic supercomputer designed by a pandimensional race and built by the Magratheans. Millions of years ago, an alien race created a supercomputer named Deep Thought, which was given the single purpose of figuring out the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. At the end of its seven-and-a-half-million-year program, Deep Thought reveals that the answer is \"forty-two.\"\n\nSensing the disappointment from this answer, Deep Thought builds an organic computer to discover the true Ultimate Question, which will hopefully make sense of the answer. This new organic computer was Earth, but it was destroyed by the Vogons mere minutes before it completed its ten-million-year task.\n\nSlartibartfast continues to explain that Magrathea has been awakened to build a second Earth—Earth Mark Two—and that the pandimensional beings who commissioned the creation of the original Earth manifest in Arthur's dimension as mice.\n\nUpon awaking, Zaphod recalls a missing memory. He explains that Yooden Vranx, the Galactic President before Zaphod, suggested that Zaphod become Galactic President and steal the Heart of Gold. Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian are then taken to meet the mice, where they will soon unite with Arthur. Frankie mouse and Benjy mouse explain to Arthur that the question they have waited ten million years for may reside in his brain, and they offer to buy it from him. Arthur refuses, and Frankie and Benjy try to take the answer by force as alarms sound and chaos ensues. Barely escaping from the mice, Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod search for a way out of Magrathea.\n\nMeanwhile, Frankie and Benjy come up with a plausible lie to sell to the rest of their pandimensional species. After Zaphod stole the Heart of Gold, two Blagulon Kappa police officers tracked him to Magrathea and enter the planet's interior attempting to apprehend him. The officers corner Zaphod, Ford, Arthur, and Trillian in a computer room and shoot at them. Suddenly, both officers drop dead. Their life support systems inexplicably exploded.\n\nZaphod, Ford, Arthur, and Trillian make it back to the Heart of Gold and Marvin, who's been lying on the ground, depressed. The group boards the starship, leaves Magrathea, and heads to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe to get something to eat.\n==="

Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...\n~~~",
    "completion": " \nAct I\n\nOffred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy. Offred’s freedom is completely restricted. She can only leave the house on shopping trips and she is watched by the Eyes everywhere she goes.\n\nOffred tells the story of her daily life, slipping into flashbacks of the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. They assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another.\n\nAfter her capture, Offred was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center, where women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.\n\nOnce Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the \"Ceremony,\" in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.\n\nAct II\n\nThe first break from Offred’s routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses.\n\nDuring one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of \"Mayday,\" an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, \"You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.\"\n\nAfter some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.\n\nSoon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday.\n\nAct III\n\nOne day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.\n\nShortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.\n==="
