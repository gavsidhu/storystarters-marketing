Now, Blanc must sift through a web of lies and red herrings to uncover the truth.\nrole: protagonist\n~~~", 
  "completion": "\nName: Benoit Blanc\nAge: 42\nGender: male\nOccupation: Private investigator\nPhysical description :  Benoit Blanc is middle-aged man with pale skin, short greying hair, and very distinct bright blue eyes. He has a very sharp taste in fashion.\nPersonality: He is flamboyant, practical, gentlemanly, somewhat eccentric, a cigar chomper, but incredibly clever, intelligent, and overall a good detective. Blanc also speaks like a member of the Southern aristocracy. He has a tendency to use phrases and words that not many people understand, but also often employs the use of metaphors during his cases. Blanc is at times sneaky, relentless, and snarky, but almost always in order to further progress during an investigation. He can also be very deceiving and manipulative. He takes his job seriously and always wants justice to be served, striving for the truth above all else. He can appear bumbling on occasions but in no doubt has a brilliant mind. He is also very kind and has a tendency of helping out the \"underdogs\".\nBackground: Blanc comes from the southern United States, and his father worked as a detective, but has since retired. He has long been regarded as an incredibly famous detective due to the number of high-profile mysteries he has investigated. He once solved a case with a tennis champion involved. He also solved the murder of a ballet dancer.\nFlaws:  Blanc needs to be constantly challenged, otherwise he falls depressive episodes. He tends to lose his sanity between cases.\nMotivation: He is motivated by justice and uncovering the truth.\nQuotes:\n\"It's a weird case from the start. A case with a hole in the center. A doughnut.\"\n\"The game is afoot. Eh, Watson?\"\n\"I suspect foul play. I have eliminated no suspects.\"\n\"Physical evidence can tell a clear story with a forked tongue.\"\n\"Why is grief the providence of youth? I don't know. But I'd imagine that age deepens all feelings.\"\n\"Best judge of character is a dog. I've found that to be true.\"\n==="
